<h1>Werecat Introduction</h1>

<p>The Werecat Rules Engine is a freely available framework for
building and evaluating simple, hierarchical rule structures.  Using
Java reflection, you can easily plug in your own data and functions to
create a highly dynamic rules-based structure with very little coding
effort. The rest of this document describes how to use the framework
for your own projects.</p>

<p><b>Sample Rules</b></p>

<p>The rules format is simple JSON, which looks like this:
<pre>
{
  "top": "testOverride",
  "version": "0.0",
  "rules": {
    "testOverride": {
        "description": "Check for override",
        "condition": "setting != null",
        "accept": "doOverride",
        "decline": "testLocation"
    },
    "testLocation": {
        "description": "Check if location is present",
        "condition": "location != null",
        "accept": "useLocation",
        "decline": "doNothing()",
    },
    ...
</pre></p>

<p>The core structure is a list of tagged rules.  The outer "top" tag
identifies the default entry point for evaluating rules, and the
"version" tag is merely for tracking changes.  Each rule element has a
name, used to reference the tree, and four attributes:

<ul>
<li>description Documentation on the purpose of the rule
<li>condition A Boolean expression evaluated for each rule
<li>accept Actions to take when a condition is true
<li>decline Actions to take when a condition is false
</ul>
</p>

<p>The condition is similar to an expression in C++, Java, or other
programming languages, and may use all the similar operators
(+,-,*,/,>,<, etc).  You can work with both numbers and strings,
including regular expression matching.  Pseudo variables can be
attached to your own data objects as described in the next
section.</p>

<p>Actions (accept or decline), can consist of two components:

<ul>
<li>tag Identify the next rule to evaluate.  A tag must match the tag of a defined rule.
<li>method Call a function in your own code.  The method must match a function you have defined, and should include any arguments.
</ul></po>

<p>
If you are using only a single action, simply include that action.
If you are multiple actions, separate them by semicolons.  (You may also omit the
action entirely if not needed). A fully loaded action might look like
this:</p>

<pre>
"action": "myMethod();nextTag"
</pre>

<p>Typically, the method will be used to update status in your Context
object, as explained in the next section.</p>

<p><b>Sample Code</b></p>

<p>The most important class when using the Rule Engine is the
RuleContext.  Each time you evaluate a Rule, you should create a
RuleContext that stores all the inputs needed in the rule engine, and
has the ability to store any outputs you want.  You should subclass
RuleContext to add your own fields and methods, like this:</p>

<pre>
public class ExampleContext extends RuleContext {
    // Inputs
    int level; // Some sample value

    // Results
    int action = 0;

    // Getter
    public int getLevel() {
	return level;
    }
    // Action
    public void setBasicAction() {
	action = 1;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Because there is a method call getLevel, you may now use the variable level in your conditions (like "level != 2").</p>

<p>Actions can call any public method of your RuleContext.  You can
use any information you need from the context, including updating
input values, or setting outputs.</p>

</p>Using the rule engine itself is very simple.  First, import the package:</p>

<pre>import com.whicken.werecat.*;</pre>

<p>Second, instantiate the engine with some JSON rules as input:</p>

<pre>
RuleFactory factory = new RuleFactory(ExampleContext.class);
RuleEngine engine = new RuleEngine();
engine.load(file, factory);
</pre>

<p>The RuleContext being used must be passed in via the RuleFactory,
so that the actions and conditions may be validated during
instantiation.  To evaluate a rule, create your context, and pass it
in to the evaluate method.  This will walk the rule structure, calling
the appropriate actions, and return when completed.</p>

<pre>
ExampleContext context = new ExampleContext();
context.level = 4;
engine.evaluate(context);
System.out.println("Result: "+context.action);
</pre>
